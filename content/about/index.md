### Hey so you want to know what's the deal with this HipsterCodes thing?

Ok, listen up, it's pretty simple.

We put hipster poster quotes here but with a programming twist.

We hope that you will like our sense of humor and share and like and cuddle our posts.

Well, that's it. I told you it's simple.

### Want us to publish your posts here?

Send your posters to `submit@hipstercodes.com`.

We'll do our secret quality control procedure on your poster, and will get back to you, usually within 2 minutes to an hour.
